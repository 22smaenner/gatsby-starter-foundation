## Marketing Examples

These were a series of LinkedIn posts I did for Development Dimensions International. I designed the graphics and wrote the copy. Some graphics were designed to also be shared on the company's Facebook page or Twitter as well.

These were a series of Instagram posts I did for the Women's Ultimate Frisbee Club team at Carnegie Mellon. I designed the graphics and captions. Some graphics were designed to also be shared on the club's Facebook page.

### [Email Newsletter](https://d64a83ca-1c7f-44e6-8def-5305300a7fe5.filesusr.com/ugd/ddc01d_ba0dff847eb140e4b3120ee2f62975fd.pdf)

This was one of the monthly newsletters I created for subscribers at Development Dimensions International. The newsletter was to let them know of recent blogs, podcast, or events we hosted and upcoming webinars they could attend. I worked with a graphic artist to prepare the content.
